#Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number. 
def descending_order(num):
    list = []
    num = str(num)
    for number in num:
     list.append(number)
     list.sort(reverse=True)
    return int(''.join(list))
